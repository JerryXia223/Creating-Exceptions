In this code, i create three Circle objects and test them with different radius values. If the radius is invalid (negative or zero), an InvalidRadiusException is thrown and caught in the Main class.

When you run this code, it will demonstrate how the Circle class sets and validates the radius and how the exception handling works.

This code ensures that the radius is greater than zero and provides informative messages for invalid radius values.
